# Simulation-of-the-Ethernet

This project is to simulate the classical Ethernet. This project uses socket API programming through a client/server application. The Ethernet is simulated by multiple processes on multiple machines. Each station in the Ethernet is simulated by a process running on workstations and the common bus is also simulated by a process.
